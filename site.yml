  title: Background
  content_markup: "<p>This project provides the first wide-ranging critical study of films about and by Asians in Australia, and by Australian filmmakers of Asia. The best way to adequately understand the field of Asian Australian cinema is to examine the mutually constitutive relationship between a history of the representation of Asian diasporas in Australia, and Asian Australian filmmaking. This project aims to chart the historical development of Asian Australian cinema to consider diasporic histories, the impacts of policies on representation, and the new aesthetic styles and production regimes created by filmmakers who have forged links, both through roots and routes, with Asia. It extends existing studies of Asians in Australian cinema that tend to discuss the representation of Asians as marginal and the cinema as multicultural.  Rather than following this framework by categorising Asian Australian cinema under the rubric of national Australian cinema, this project offers a new approach by framing the cinema as diasporic and thus, transnational. The project\xE2\x80\x99s aims are aligned with three central research themes: History, Policy and Ethics.</p>\n\n\
    <p><strong>History:</strong> utilising Australia\xE2\x80\x99s national film archives, the project will identify and analyse key moments in the development of films about and by Asians in Australia, and by Australian filmmakers of Asia. These moments will be documented through a number of contextualised case studies and provide a sophisticated understanding of the production and reception of Asian Australian cinema at important national and transnational junctures.</p>\n\n\
    <p><strong>Policy:</strong> through an analysis of how immigration, film, cultural and creative industry policies have facilitated Asian Australian cinema\xE2\x80\x99s emergence and development, the project will develop an innovative theoretical framework for investigating Asian Australian cinema utilising a diasporic cinema studies perspective. This approach foregrounds the impact that government policies have had on the representation of Asians in Australian cinema, and will be of national benefit by creating a valuable resource for policy makers, promoting creative film innovation and adding an original intellectual framework to international film studies.</p>\n\n\
    <p><strong>Ethics:</strong> as the first sustained and critical study of the representation of Asians in Australian cinema, the project will extend current theorisations on the representation of Asians that focus on the cultural hybridity of ethnic identity, by emphasising the ethics of ethnic identity. By using ethics to examine how identities are governed through historical developments, policy implementations and resource allocation, this project departs from existing debates about the identity politics of inclusion/exclusion, self/other, and sameness/difference, and highlights instead how ethnic Asian identities are negotiated through practices of official representation, group management and individual self-cultivation.  This approach will benefit scholars and filmmakers by providing a new perspective on the ethics of recognition, justice and distribution.</p>\n"

  synopsis_markup: |
    <p>Essentially, the film was a Pacific Island romance, including the elements of greed, blackbirding, the love of white adventurer Conn for an Island girl (later revealed to be white), and action sequences such as a bar-room brawl, and a battle to rescue Luya and other &lsquo;dusky maidens&rsquo; from the clutches of Fursey, the villain. Locations show authentic native villages, sailing craft, and a spectacular longhouse built on an atoll.

  synopsis: Since his childhood in Okinawa, Asano has had a mnemonic memory. For him, words have tactile forms and tastes that make them constantly present in his mind; as a result, he can't forget a word once he's heard it. Now he is in "gridlock," his memories blocking the flow of life. Asano finds himself in Hong Kong's Dive Bar, drawn by the colour of the gay club's couches, a shade of blue which reminds him of the sea. (Internet Movie Database http://www.imdb.com)

    <p>The Gogodala, like other people of the swampy lowlands of western Papua New Guinea, traditionally produced magnificent carvings for use in ceremonies. In the early decades of this century, European missionaries and their Papuan evangelists siezed upon such objects as symbols of the &lsquo;heathen darkness&rsquo; from which the Gogodala were to be rescued. By the 1930s, the work of the missionaries had resulted in mass burnings of ritual carvings and the suppression of traditional ceremonies. (Ronin Films, http://www.roninfilms.com.au)</p>

    <p>Although the film uses the meeting of 3,000 Interhash participants in Bali as its springboard. Its main thrust concerns the impact of tourism on Balinese culture and life. The Galungan festival is used as a counterpoint to the excessive festivities of the Interhash participants and contrasts the natural grace and good manners of the average Balinese with the behaviour of many tourists. The film also explores the historical and psychological foundations of the Hash House Harrier movement.</p>

    <p>By the middle of the 19th century, the West had become totally enchanted with a heady new brew: tea. But, China held the monopoly on its trade and manufacture, which it fiercely guarded for more than 5000 years. The British Empire sought to change that, by mounting one of the most audacious espionage missions the world had ever seen: to steal the secret of tea from Imperial China. The man they entrusted with this mission was Robert Fortune, a 36 year old Scottish botanist. (NFSA, http://www.nfsa.gov.au/)</p>
